Note: I have changed the code about the RunImageRenderer method so I
submitted it.

Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

1. For the Core of ImageRenderer, you didn't need to use
while(scan.hasNext()), but for the Completion (animated images) you did need to
use while(scan.hasNext()). Explain the difference.

If you don't use while(scan.hasNext()), then the program will only read 
the first picture, but a moving picture is made up of many pictures,
 so a loop must be added to let the program read the file continuously 
until all the data has been read.

2. If an image was standard SVGA size (800x600), how big might a ppm file of the
image be, given that each character in the file (including the spaces) requires
1 byte?  How much worse is this than a typical jpg or png file of the same
number of pixels?  (you may need to go and find some typical images that are
about 800x600 pixels).

A pixel needs to write 3 numbers and 3 spaces in the file, 
assuming that each number occupies 2 bytes on average, then a pixel It takes 9 
bytes and 800 * 600 pictures have 480000 pixels, so it takes about 4320000 bytes. 
Converted to 4218.75 kb, it is about 4.12 MB, which is about 5 times the size 
of a normal jpg or png file.
