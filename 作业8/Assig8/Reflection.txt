Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Explain why "off-by-one" errors are so easy to make when programming with
arrays.

Since the positions of the array and ArrayList start from 0, if you forget to read them start at position zero, 
it is easy for the array to out of  the bound, while in a arrayList, if you delete the value at a certain position,
 the positions of all values after this position will go further, which is also easy to make mistakes. 
 If they are other object classes, special attention should be paid to determining whether 
the value at this position is null or not. If it is null, no method can be referenced. 
This is the most error-prone places. Therefore, it is necessary to determine whether this position is null 
before referring to the method of values in the array every time.

2. Both DominoGame and EarthquakeAnalyser used another class that was written for you.
This saved you writing some code, but also constrained you to write the program in a particular way. 
Discuss advantages and disadvantages you found when having a predefined class that you had to use as part of your program.

Advantages: When we need to analyze earthquakes, it is very convenient to define an earthquake class to access, 
and we can use arrays to store objects of earthquake class, especially when the earthquake value is very large, 
we can well separate the two different classes of analysis earthquake and earthquake.The same is true for domino games, 
where domino cards are a category and domino game classe is the program for handling objects of each domino card class,
 so that the benefits are to encapsulate the code so that each class is ordered, domino game class is used to add buttons 
and make rules, and domino classe are used to describe a domino card.

Disadvantages: Most of the time we have some special earthquakes, or special domino cards.
 The domino class and earthquake class we define cannot accurately describe each object. 
Also, the parameters of each domino card defined in this way cannot be modified. We can only 
replace the original domino card by making a new domino card, which will obviously be inconvenient.
 If I make it, maybe I will add some methods for users to modify the attributes of the domino card.

In a word, I really agree with such an approach, which is very helpful for me 
to conceive the program, and I strongly support doing so in the program.
