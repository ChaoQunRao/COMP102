Questions for Reflection: 
=========================

Almost certainly, when you wrote your code, you had bugs in it which you had to
fix. Some of the bugs were probably easy to identify; others probably took more
time.

1. Characterise the kinds of bugs you had to deal with (eg spelling, punctuation, ...)
        (1). The package "ecs100" can't be found..(Because I didn't download this file)
        (2). The array I created is out of bounds, I spend many time to fix it because I don't
        konw the first number of the array is a[0] rather than a[1].
        (3). When using¡°for¡±£¨A statement£©,I wana write "for(int i = 1;i<100;i++) ", but
        I often mistake ";" and ",". Always It will be "for(int i = 1,i<100,i++)".
        (4).  Using Chinese punctuations like "¡®¡¯ ¡£ £¨£©".
        (5). Many of my programs can run without any mistake, but many times they can't 
         run as I want.
        (6). I can't think of more, because only the above impressed me deeply.


2. What techniques for fixing the bugs were most effective for you? Can you
think of better approaches that you could use next time?
       (1). If the program is running incorrectly, I will find and check the wrong line of code
         according to the system prompt.
       (2). If the result is inconsistent with what I think, because I have the habit of doing 
        mind maps, I will check whether my steps are wrong according to mind maps.
       (3). I think I should write more comments in my code next time, which will make it
         easier for me and others to understand my code.
