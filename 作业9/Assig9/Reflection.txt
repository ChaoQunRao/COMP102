Note that this is a description of this operating procedure:
Compared with this job requirement, I added more functions. back button is used to return to the previous picture
 ( invalid for length and width changes ), while expand is required to be completed by the challenge part. On top of this, 
I added a new function. Click ExpendWithMouse to open and click to enlarge the picture. The bottom two silders are 
used to change the size of the picture. However, if you want to save your adjusted picture size, I only provide a way 
to save an integer multiple, that is, if you enlarge the picture by more than 2 times, clicking Save will automatically 
save the enlarged picture by an integer multiple.

Questions for Reflection: 
=========================


1. Some of the methods in the ImageProcessor program could be done in two
different ways: "in-place" (only using the array containing the image), or
using a temporary array to store the image as it was being processed. Discuss
the advantages and disadvantages of the two approaches. 

When we only use " in place" way, we can easily change the size of the values of the array elements.
 If we use temporary array to store pictures, we can exchange the elements in the array more easily. 
For example, it is better for us to use the latter method to rotate the pictures, and it is better for us to 
use the previous method if the colors of the pictures are darker or lighter.

The disadvantage of " in place" is that it is difficult to deal with complex 
problems, such as swapping array elements or requiring expend pictures.

One of the big disadvantages of using temporary array is that it adds a lot of computation, 
because traversing an array requires nesting of two for loops, using temporary array 
usually requires many for loops. Another disadvantage that I think is very important is that
 most of the time we pass the changed array to the current array directly with code such as
                               "this. image = newImage(temporary array)", 
but sometimes it is especially important to pay attention to the address instead of the value
 stored in the image array memory and pass only the address of the local array. Most of the time, 
when you want to assign values directly to image arrays, you'd better use the for loop to change
 the value of each element, and passing the address can easily lead to misunderstandings later.
